Synopsys DesignWare CSI-2 Host controller

Description
-----------

This HW block is used to receive image coming from an MIPI CSI-2 compatible
camera.

Required properties:
- compatible		: shall be "snps,dw-csi"
- reg			: physical base address and size of the device memory
			  mapped registers;
- interrupts		: DW CSI-2 Host interrupts
- phys			: List of one PHY specifier (as defined in
			  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt).
			  This PHY is a MIPI DPHY working in RX mode.
- resets		: Reference to a reset controller (optional)

The per-board settings:
 - port sub-node describing a single endpoint connected to the camera as
   described in video-interfaces.txt[1].

Example:

	csi2: csi2@3000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-csi";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = < 0x03000 0x7FF>;
		phys = <&mipi_dphy_rx>;
		resets = <&dw_rst 1>;
		interrupts = <2>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			csi_ep1: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&camera_1>;
				data-lanes = <1 2>;
			};
		};
	};
