Synopsys DesignWare CSI-2 Host Media Device

The Synopsys DesignWare CSI-2 Host subsystem comprises of multiple
sub-devices represented by separate device tree nodes. Currently this includes:
plat-csi, video-device, and dw-mipi-csi.

The sub-subdevices are defined as child nodes of the common 'camera' node which
also includes common properties of the whole subsystem not really specific to
any single sub-device.

Common 'camera' node
--------------------

Required properties:

- compatible: must be "snps,plat-csi", "simple-bus"

The 'camera' node must include at least one 'video-device' and one 'dw-mipi-csi'
child node.

'video-device' device nodes
-------------------

Required properties:

- compatible: "snps,video-device"
- dmas, dma-names: List of one DMA specifier and identifier string (as defined
 in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt) per port. Each port
 requires a DMA channel with the identifier string set to "port" followed by
 the port index.

Image sensor nodes
------------------

The sensor device nodes should be added to their control bus controller (e.g.
I2C0) nodes and linked to a port node in the dw-mipi-csi,using the common video
interfaces bindings, defined in video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

 i2c@0x02000 {
 compatible = "snps,designware-i2c";
 #address-cells = <1>;
 #size-cells = <0>;
 reg = <0x02000 0x100>;
 clock-frequency = <400000>;
 clocks = <&i2cclk>;
 interrupts =<0>;
 ov: camera@0x36 {
 compatible = "ovti,ov5647";
 reg = <0x36>;
 port {
 camera_1: endpoint {
 remote-endpoint = <&csi1_ep1>;
 clock-lanes = <0>;
 data-lanes = <1 2 >;
           };
 };
     };
 };

 camera {
 compatible = "snps,plat-csi", "simple-bus";
 #address-cells = <1>;
 #size-cells = <1>;
 ranges;
 video_device: video-device@0x10000 {
 compatible = "snps,video-device";
 dmas = <&axi_vdma_0 0>;
 dma-names = "vdma0";
 };

 csi2_1: csi2@0x03000 {
 compatible = "snps,dw-mipi-csi";
 #address-cells = <1>;
 #size-cells = <0>;
 reg = < 0x03000 0x7FF>;
 interrupts = <2>;
 data-lanes = <2>;
 output-type = <2>;

 phys = <&mipi_phy_ctrl1 0>;
 phy-names = "csi2-dphy";

 /*IPI Related Configurations*/
 ipi-mode = <0>;
 ipi-color-mode = <0>;
 ipi-auto-flush = <1>;
 virtual-channel = <0>;

 /* Camera MIPI CSI-2 (CSI1) */
 port@1 {
 reg = <1>;
 csi1_ep1: endpoint {
 remote-endpoint = <&camera_1>;
 data-lanes = <1 2>;
           };
 };
         };
 };
};

The dw-mipi-csi device binding is defined in snps,dw-mipi-csi.txt.
