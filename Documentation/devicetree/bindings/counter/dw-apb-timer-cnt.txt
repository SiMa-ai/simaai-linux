Synopsys DesignWare APB timer counter

This driver exposes a simple incremental counter for the timer.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "snps,dw-apb-timer-counter-2.12a".
- reg:			Must be set to the memory region of the timer.

Optional property:
- interrupts: 		Should contain the channel interrupt signals to handle
			channel overflow
- snps,channels:	Number of channels in the timer

Example:
			counter0: counter@704000 {
				compatible = "snps,dw-apb-timer-counter-2.12a";
				reg = <0x0 0x00704000 0x0 0x000000b0>;
				interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
				interrupts = <GIC_SPI 8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
					     <GIC_SPI 9 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
					     <GIC_SPI 10 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
					     <GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
				snps,channels = <0x4>;
				status = "okay";
			};
